## How to play a custom challenge
To start, go to the main menu and click "Challenges". A menu will pop-up and you can select the challenge you want to play. Each challenge will have it's own save file, and the color will change depending on if you have cleared it or not. Some challenges require others to be completed before showing up.

## Adding More Challenges
Adding challenges is easy! There are several different spots where you can put your file. 
1) %APPDATA%\LocalLow\Red Nexus Games Inc\Peglin\Custom Challenges\challenges
2) Bepinex Plugin folder (This will change depending on how you installed BepInEx)

When using either directory, you can put your challenges in their own folder. The file must end with a .json extension

## Including Custom Challenges in your Mod
There are two ways to include challenges in your mod.

1) As an embeded resource with the path Resources/Challenges/yourfilenamehere.json
2) Included with your mod with a .json extension
